# Memory
is a Console-based Unix-compatible Card Game.

## To run the game
Type `./memory.sh` in your console, and press `Enter`!

## How the game works
When the game begins, you will see a 4x4 grid of cards. (Total of 16 cards, 8 pairs)
Your job is to flip the matching pairs until *ALL* cards have been flipped!

## Instructions
1. Choose the pair of cards to flip by typing the number sequence in the order of **Row1 Col1 Row2 Col2**.
\nExample: *1312* is Card 1 at (1, 3) and Card 2 at (1, 2)
2. If a matching pair is found, the cards will be flipped immediately.
3. If the cards weren't matching, the values of the cards will be displayed for 2 seconds.
4. Once all cards have been flipped, you'll be redirected to the ending page where you have an option to play another.

## To quit the game
Press `ctrl+C` or `cmd+C` anytime to exit.
